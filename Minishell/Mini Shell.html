<h2> Description</h2>
</a>

<p>This assignment helps you learn about 
processes and basic process management in a shell.
You are asked to write a simple shell program called <tt>minish</tt>.
This shell must work as follows. You start the shell by typing 
<tt>minish</tt> at the prompt.
This will give a prompt of your shell as follows:

</p><pre>minish&gt;
</pre>

From here onwards, you should be able to execute and control 
<b>any program/command</b> just as you
would in a normal shell. 
For instance 

<pre>minish&gt; ls

[ OUTPUT OF ls COMMAND SHOWN HERE ]

minish&gt;
</pre>


<p>
Additionally, your shell should be able to do the following: 
</p>

<ol> 

	<li>
		Execute commands with multiple arguments. For example:
		<pre>		minish&gt; Command arg1 arg2 arg3
		</pre>
	</li>

	<li>
		Execute commands in either foreground or background mode. In 
foreground mode, the shell just waits for the command to complete before
 displaying the shell prompt again (as in the above example). In 
background mode, a command is executed with an ampersand <tt>&amp;</tt> 
suffix. The shell prompt appears immediately after typing a command name
 (say Command1) and shell becomes ready to accept and execute the next 
command (say Command2), even as Command1 continues executing in the <i>background</i>. For example:
		<pre>		minish&gt; Command1 &amp;
		minish&gt; Command2

		[OUTPUT OF Command1 AND Command2 MAY INTERLEAVE HERE IN ARBITRARY ORDER]
		</pre>

	</li>

	<li>
		Maintain multiple processes running in background mode simultaneously. For example:
		<pre>		minish&gt; Command1 &amp;
		minish&gt; Command2 &amp;
		minish&gt; Command3 &amp;
		minish&gt; 

		[OUTPUT OF Command1, Command2, AND Command3 MAY INTERLEAVE HERE IN ARBITRARY ORDER]

		</pre>
	</li>

	<li>	
		Redirect the input of a command from a file. For example:
		<pre>		minish&gt; Command &lt; input_file
		</pre>
		Redirect the output of a command to a file. For example:
		<pre>		minish&gt; Command &gt; output_file
		</pre>
	</li>

	<li>
		Implement command filters, i.e., redirect the stdout of one command to stdin of another using pipes. For example:
		<pre>		minish&gt; ls -l | wc -l
		</pre>
		<pre>		minish&gt; cat somefile | grep somestring | less
		</pre>

		Ideally, your shell should be able to handle any number of filter components.
	</li>

	<li>
		Terminate a process by pressing <tt>[Ctrl-C]</tt>.  Your shell must not get killed; only the process running inside your shell must terminate.
	</li>

	<li>
		Temporarily stop a process using <tt>[Ctrl-Z]</tt>.  Your shell must 
not stop; only the process running inside your shell must stop.  Your 
shell must be able to hold multiple processes in stopped state. 
	</li>

	<li>
		Kill a stopped process or a process in background using the <tt>kill</tt> command. 
	</li>

	<li>
		Any signal should be delivered to the entire process-group of the 
immediate child process, not just to the immediate child process. For 
example, if mysh starts process A and process A forks another process B,
 then any signal should be delivered to both process A and process B. 
How will you do this? For this you need to understand the notion of a 
process group. Check out the man pages for <tt>setsid()</tt> and <tt>killpg()</tt>.
	</li>

	<li> 
		Bring a backgrounded process to foreground using the <tt>fg</tt>  directive.  The <tt>fg</tt> directive must be able to bring any stopped/backgrounded process to foreground using the <tt>%N</tt> argument.
	</li>

	<li>
		Be able to execute any feasible combinations of the above features.
	</li>

	<li>
		The <tt>exit</tt>  command should terminate your shell.  Take care to avoid orphan processes.
	</li>

	<li>
		The <tt>cd</tt> command must actually change the directory of your shell  and the <tt>pwd</tt> command must return the current directory of your shell. Note that normal <tt>fork-exec</tt> mechanism won't work here. Why?
	</li>

</ol>

<h2>Do Nots:</h2>
</a>
<ul> 
	<li>
		DO NOT use any special wrapper libraries or classes to borrow the 
basic functionality required in this assignment. If in doubt, ask the 
instructor first BEFORE doing so.
	</li> 
	<li>
		DO NOT use the <b>system(...) </b> syscall to execute the programs in your shell directly.
	</li> 
	<li> 
		DO NOT write five or six different programs, one for each feature. Write <b>one single program</b> that includes all the above features. 
	</li> 

	<li>
		You do not need to implement any scripting functionalities.
	</li>

	<li>
		You do not need to implement wild character expansions such as *,?,[0-9], etc.
	</li>
</ul> 

<a name="hints">
<h2>Hints:</h2> 
</a>

<ul> 
  <li>Build  and test one functionality at a time. </li> 
  <li>Make backup copies of partially working versions of your code. 
This way, if you irreparably screw up your code, then you can at least 
roll back to your last backup copy. </li> 
  <li>First design your data structures and code-structure before you 
begin coding each feature. Anticipate specific problems you will face. </li> 
  <li>Check out man page for the following, which might be useful:
    <ul> 
	<li>fork()</li>
	<li>execv() and execl() (which one should you use?)</li>
	<li>waitpid()</li> 
	<li>dup2() (for stdin/stdout redirection) </li>
	<li>pipe()</li> 
	<li>open()</li> 
	<li>close()</li> 
	<li>fileno()</li> 
	<li> kill()</li> 
	<li> chdir()</li> 
	<li> getcwd()</li> 
	<li>killpg()</li> 
	<li>setsid()</li> 
	<li>getgrp()</li> 
	<li>getpgid()</li> 
	<li>tcsetpgrp()</li> 
    </ul> 
  </li> 
  <li>Know the difference between <b>SIGSTOP </b>and <b>SIGTSTP</b> and which one to use?</li> 
</ul>

                10 - Delivery of signal to entire process group i.e. sending a stop, kill, or continue signal to a chain of filters.

        10 - Error Handling
                Most important part here is to make sure that you check for and handle all errors cleanly.
                In other words, your program shouldn't crash or produce meaningless output.
                For example, you should handle all errors returned by ALL systems calls used in your
                program. Also check for other common error conditions in your program.
                But don't go overboard with error checking.
                We will not try to intentionally break your code with bad
                input that may be irrelevant to the assignment's goals.

        Total = 190
