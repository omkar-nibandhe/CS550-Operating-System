<h2>Objective</h2>
You will implement a kernel-level pipe for exchanging strings among user-level processes.
You will learn about concurrency, synchronization, and various kernel primitives.

<a name="problem"></a>
<h2>Problem Statement</h2>
This is a classical producer-consumer problem. 
Implement a miscellaneous character device in the Linux Kernel. 
This device must maintain a FIFO queue (i.e. a pipe) of maximum N strings (configured as a module parameter).
<ol>
<li> In user space, there are several concurrent processes that are consumers and producers of strings.
</li><li> Producers produce strings and write them to a character device (say /dev/mypipe).
</li><li> Consumers read the strings from the character device and print it on the screen.
</li><li> When the pipe is full, i.e. when there are N strings stored in character device, then any producer trying to write will block.
</li><li> When the pipe is empty, i.e. when there are 0 strings stored in character device, then any consumer trying to read will block.
</li><li> When a consumer reads from a (full) pipe, it wakes up all 
blocked producers. In this case, no blocked consumer should be woken up.
</li><li> When a producer writes to a (empty) pipe, it wakes up all 
blocked consumers. In this case, no blocked producer should be woken up.
</li></ol>

<h3>Notes</h3>
<ul>
<li> You might have noticed that this is not really a "character device"
 by strict definition, because it doesn't provide a byte-stream 
abstractions. Instead user processes are writing and reading whole 
strings at a time. We are just using the character device  interface in 
Linux as a convenient mechanism to implement a pipe of strings.
</li><li> The reason "full" and "empty" are in brackets in the last two 
steps above is to let you choose whether to notify upon every single 
read/write or only when really necessary. Whatever option you choose, 
make sure no notifications are "lost" by blocked producers/consumers. 
</li></ul>

<h2>What you need to learn to complete this assignment</h2>
You have to implement a character device as a kernel module, using what 
you learned earlier about kernel modules and character devices.
You can use either the semaphore-version of the solution to 
producer-consumer problem or a monitor-type solution, both of which were
 covered in class.
It is likely the semaphore version may be easier to implement.
You will need to learn the following kernel mechanisms.
<ul>
<li>Memory allocation in kernel using kmalloc or kzalloc.
</li><li>Using semaphores in kernel using the following functions: 
sema_init, DEFINE_SEMAPHORE, down_interruptible (preferred over down), 
and up.
</li><li>For alternative implementations using mutexes and waitqs: 
mutex_init, DEFINE_MUTEX, mutex_lock, mutex_unlock, 
init_wait_queue_head, wait_event_interruptible (preferred over 
wait_event), and wake_up_interruptible (or wake_up).
</li></ul>

<h2>Sample user-space code</h2>
As a hint, below is the sample pseudo-code for producer and consumer 
processes. You need to modify this code to your implementation of 
/dev/mypipe character device.

<p>
First the Producer process:
</p><pre>	fd = open("/dev/mypipe", O_WRONLY);
	// check for error during open 

	while (/*some condition*/) {

		//  generate a string somehow, making sure to identify the producer and the string number
		// For example,
		//		"Producer p generated this string i"
		// increment i across each loop iteration 
		// use a unique p for each producer.

		// write string to pipe
		n = write( fd, string, size_of_string);
		// don't forget to check for write error. 
	}

	close(fd);

</pre>

<p>
Next the Consumer process:
</p><pre>	fd = open("/dev/mypipe", O_RDONLY);
	// check for error during open 

	while (/*some condition*/) {

		// read a string from the pipe
		n = read( fd, string, MAX_LEN);
		// don't forget to check for readerror. 

		// print the string to screen, making sure to identify the consumer who read it
		// For example,
		//		"Consumer c, iteration j:" followed by string you read above 
		// increment j across each loop iteration 
		// use a unique c for each consumer.
	}

	close(fd);
</pre>

<h2> Frequently asked questions </h2>
<p>
Q: Is there any locking in user space? 
<br>
A: No, all synchronization happens in kernel space.

</p><p>
Q: Do we use threads or processes to implement producers/consumers in user space.
<br>
A: Processes.

</p><p>
Q: How to I terminate producers and consumers?
<br>
A: After fixed number of iterations would be easiest. If you want to use other termination conditions, check with me/TAs.

</p><p> 
Q: Why should I use *_interruptible versions of kernel functions?
<br>
A: So that your producer/consumer code can be terminated using Ctrl-C in user space. We'll test for this during demo.

</p><p>
Q: How does the producer generate string? Manually, or from a file, or automatically?
<br>
A: Please see instructions in the pseudo-code above. Automatic 
generation would probably be the easiest, since it would help you track 
which producer and which consumer handle each string.

</p><p>
Q: How long should be each string? Can we assume fixed length?
<br>
A: At least 5 characters per string. You you can assume fixed length for
 each string. But the length should be explicitly exchanged between your
 user and kernel code.

</p><h2>Grading Guidelines</h2>
<ul>
	<li> 20 - Code works for one producer and one consumer.
	</li><li> 30 - Code works for multiple concurrent producers and consumers. We may test for up to 5 of each.
	</li><li> 20 - No deadlocks. All producers and consumers make progress as long as at least one of each is running.
	</li><li> 20 - No race conditions. Each string that is written by 
producers is read EXACTLY once by one consumer. No string is lost. No 
string is read more than once. 
	</li><li> 10 - Producers block  on write when pipe is full
	</li><li> 10 - Consumers block on read when pipe is empty
	</li><li> 10 - Blocked producers are not woken up by other producers. Blocked consumers are not woken up by other consumers.
	</li><li> 10 - Blocked producers and consumers can be terminated using Ctrl-C
	</li><li> 20 - Handle all major error conditions.
	</li><li> 40 - Questions based on the assignment.
	</li><li> 10 - Clean, modular, and commented code. Clean readable output. No "giant" functions. Minimal use of global variables.
